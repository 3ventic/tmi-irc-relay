tmi-irc-relay
=============

This is a super crude script that makes Twitch's TMI chat feel more IRC native.

To use, checkout the repo and run

```
npm install
node index.js
```

Then, configure your IRC client to connect to (if running on your local system)

```
localhost:6969
```

If you want to contrib, you can. The script needs a lot of work as it was just thrown together in my spare time.
